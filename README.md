# Tempinator	
A simple Python script that cleans the Temp directory in a Windows machine.
## Description
I wrote this script when my friend asked if there is a software available to clean the Windows temporary folder at startup. In case you feel like compiling and using this, you can use the installer [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AoUyqBm0j5hfwAsRleQXX0bWGnyT).
